None of us have any symptoms or have been out of Canada in the past 14 days. I have confirmed that, including me, 4 of us have both doses of the Covid vaccine, and I am waiting for response from the remaining people. We will be bringing 2 cars with us on Friday, and the friend who is coming on Saturday will be bringing his own car. Additionally, we will be leaving Windsor at around 12 pm on Friday and probably arriving at around 4 pm. I will update you once I have confirmed vaccine dose counts from the other members, along with their names and numbers for tracing.
